# Enhancements to `Login` and `Sign Up` Pages

### Login Page Modifications:
- **Updated UI Structure**: The design of the login page has been refined with more aesthetically pleasing gaps and spacing, improving the overall user experience.
- **Added Validations**: Form validations have been integrated, ensuring that user input meets the required criteria before submission.
- **Password Visibility Toggle**: The input component has been enhanced to allow users to toggle the visibility of their password via a password icon, improving accessibility and usability.
- **Improved Folder Structure**: The folder structure for the page has been re-organized as follows:
  ```
  SomePage/
  ├── index.vue       // The main page template
  └── index.script.ts // The page's TypeScript logic
  ```
  This structure is cleaner and more scalable than using a single file, making it easier to maintain and expand.

### Signup Page Additions:
- **Page Structure**: A new signup page has been added, following the same improved folder structure for better organization.
- **Validation**: Validation for the signup form has been implemented, ensuring data integrity during submission.
- **Store Modifications**: The store has been updated to support signup functionality. A new `createProfile` method has been added in the actions to handle user profile creation.
- **Error Handling**: The error handling mechanism has been updated to improve the user experience during signup, providing clear feedback in case of errors.

### Benefits:
- **Clean and Scalable Structure**: By separating the Vue file and the script file, the structure is more modular and easier to manage as the application grows.
- **Enhanced User Experience**: The visual and functional improvements on both the login and signup pages contribute to a smoother and more intuitive user experience.
- **Improved Maintainability**: The organized structure and enhanced features allow for easier debugging, testing, and future updates.
