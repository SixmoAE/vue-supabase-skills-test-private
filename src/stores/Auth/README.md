# Organized and Scalable Store Structure  
When working with state management libraries like **Pinia**, adopting a modular folder structure can greatly enhance both readability and scalability. Instead of consolidating all logic into a single file, consider structuring your store as follows:  

```
SomeStore/
├── actions.ts   // Define functions for state modifications and asynchronous logic.
├── getters.ts   // Encapsulate computed properties derived from the state.
├── setters.ts   // Manage controlled updates to specific state properties.
├── state.ts     // Declare the reactive state structure.
├── index.ts     // Combine and export all parts of the store for easy integration.
```  

### Benefits:  
- **Improved Readability**: Each file has a clear, focused purpose, making it easier to locate and understand specific logic.  
- **Enhanced Scalability**: The structure naturally accommodates growing codebases by keeping the store logic modular and organized.  
- **Ease of Maintenance**: Debugging and updating becomes simpler, as changes can be made in isolated files without affecting unrelated logic.  

This approach provides a clean and professional foundation for managing your store, ensuring that your project remains maintainable as it evolves.
